          <p>The Lord has blessed Molly and I with a wonderful family. We have three beautiful little girls each with her own unique personality and talents. Both Molly and I come from relatively large families, and we always knew that we would want a large family for our own. From the moment our family started, we made the promise to one another that Christ would be the focal point of our marriage and upbringing of our children. Now, we've been plessed with the opportunity to bring another little girl into our family, to show her the love that God has shown us, and to raise her in the teachings of Christ.</p>

        <h2>Why Adoption?</h2>
        <p>We believe that adoption is a beautiful representation of was Christ has done for us in our lives. Through no goodness of our own, God chose us to become His sons and daughters and heirs to His blessings. With this picture in mind, we looked at the need of international adoption as a way for us to display the work of Christ in us and find our role within the Great Commission. By bringing this child into our family, we will have the opportunity to raise her in a Christian home where she can hear and see the goodness of God.  We're so thankful that God has blessed us enough to be able to pursue this goal, and with the help of family and friends, we're sure we'll be able to achieve it.</p>

      <h2>Why Taiwan?</h2>
      <p>During the initial process, we tried to determine where the greatest need for adoption would be.  We looked at many different factors, but the major one for Molly and I was Gospel saturation.  How many of the people group was Christian (and in turn, how likely would a child raised there become a Christian)?</p>
      <p>After looking at many different countries, a few being removed from our list because of restrictions we were unable to meet (age, size of family, etc.), we were led to adopt from Taiwan.  According to a 2005 census, only 3.9% of Taiwan is professing Christian.  Buddhism is the largest religion at 35.1% followed by Taoism at 33%.  We also found during our research that many missionaries were being removed from Taiwan for financial reasons.  This made it all the more apparent to us that there was a high probability that a child growing up in Taiwan would not come to know Jesus Christ as Savior.</p>

        <h2>How You Can Help</h2>

        <p>During our process, we hope that those around us will be able to participate along side us in our efforts adopt.  We've outlined three tangible ways that you may help us achieve our goals.  We certainly understand that not everyone will be able to help in every way, but as you feel led, we pray that you would be willing to use your resources to help us in any way you can.</p>

        <div class="help-item">
          <h3>1. Donate</h3>
          <p>We truly appreciate anyone who is willing to give of their financial resources in order to be a blessing during this process. Your donation will be used directly to fund the adoption process (processing fees, orphanage & adoption agency fees, travel expenses, etc.). If you're able to and would like to give in person, feel free to do so.  For those unable to or who would rather give online, we have set up a donation account for you to give [link to page].  Any amount will go a long way in getting us closer to our goal of bringing this young child into our family.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="help-item">
          <h3>2. Spread the word</h3>
          <p>Our circle of family / friends / acquaintences is only so large, but there may be people out there who don't directly know us and are willing to help.  Please share our page on Facebook or Twitter [links to share urls] or you can give out a link to our site via email or other medium.  The more people who hear, the quicker we'll reach our goal.</p>

        <div class="help-item">
          <h3>3. Pray</h3>
          <p>Last, but not least, you can pray for us. The orphan crisis is one that needs God's help.  We ask that you would pray for us during this process, pray for the orphans around the world, and pray that God would ignite in the hearts of His people a burden for orphaned children.  Great things happen when God's people are in prayer for one another, and we would truly appreciate you taking our need to Him.</p>
